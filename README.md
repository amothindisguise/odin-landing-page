Project Title: Odin Landing Page

Description:

In this project, we are tasked to create a landing page applying all the topics covered in The Odin Project course.

The landing page has 4 sections, not including the footer; the Home, Header Link One, Header Link Two, Header Link three.

The Home Section consists of the banner and headline of the landing page.

The Header Link One is the feature part. The div elements can be substituted to img.

The Header Link Two is for the quotes and testimonials.

Lastly, the Header Link Three for Call to Action section.

The elements do not adapt to the screen yet when resized.
